# SkewT-Project

The following repository contains 3 python files, the sounding text file from KFFC, and the png image of the sounding itself.

The 3 python files are the following:

Skewt.py, which sets up the skewT logP plot and overlays the sounding data obtained from the text file, 
Bolton.py, which produces functions to calculate the skew T paramters on the plot, 
And finally readsoundings.py which reads in the sounding text file obtained from the SPC site.
